# Casio-CG100-Snake
A micropython snake game made for the Casio CG100 in my free time.  
- Uses casioplot library to draw onto the screen. 
- There are 4 game modes (Easy, Normal, Hard & Impossible), each is progressively faster and more difficult
- This project will be updated when I feel like it, if you find any bugs I can't guarantee a fix by me

# Installation
  1. Turn on your calculator
  2. Connect your calculator to a Windows, Mac or Linux computer with a USB-C cable that supports data transfer
  3. Copy the snakeCs.py file to the calculator (might show up as 'USB Drive' or something similar in the file system)
  4. Safely Eject the Calculator before removing the cable
  5. Navigate to the python app on the calculator
  6. Use the tools button, select File -> Open -> snakeCs.py
  7. Use the tab right button to enter the Shell
  8. The Game should now be running -> repeat steps 5 to 7 to run it again in the future. 

# Controls
  1. Use number keys and multiply key to select your desired mode.
  2. Use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake
  3. On the game over screen use the ok key to replay
  4. Use the AC key to exit at any time

# Companion Scripts
It is bundled with a simple tkinter based leaderboard system for regular computers that uses a base 26 code to attempt to verify genuine scores. This highscore code can be displayed on the calculator using the EXE button when on the game over screen. The leaderboard system can't be installed on the calculator.
