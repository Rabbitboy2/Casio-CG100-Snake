# Casio-CG100-Snake
A micropython snake game made for the Casio CG100 in my free time.  Uses casioplot library to draw onto the screen. It is bundled with a leader board system for regular computers that uses a base 26 code to attempt to verify genuine results. This code can be displayed on the calculator using the EXE button.
